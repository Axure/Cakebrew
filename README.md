# Cakebrew

The Homebrew GUI App for OS X

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brunophilipe/Cakebrew.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brunophilipe/Cakebrew)

## About

Cakebrew does for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) what Synaptics does to Linux package managers. With Cakebrew you can search, install, uninstall and update formulae and the Homebrew repository, all from within the app.

Do you need to use Homebrew but are afraid to use the terminal? Cakebrew is the app for you!

### Version 1.0.10 Release Candidate 2 (November 2, 2014)

Lots of changes were made, so a RC version before pushing to the main release tree is a good thing to do. If you are interested in testing the new version of Cakebrew with new features (and, just maybe, some undiscovered bugs), [please download it here](https://www.cakebrew.com/files/cakebrew-1.0.10rc2.zip).

### Yosemite

All bugs introduced in Yosemite turn out to be problems with the beta version itself. If Homebrew works in your terminal it should work with Cakebrew.
